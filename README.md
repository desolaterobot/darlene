## Sort every file by size in real time. Delete those you don't need.

Darlene is a tool that scans a given folder and sorts every file, including those within nested folders, by size in descending order. This helps to remove files you don't need, searching from the largest file downwards. Useful for decluttering deeply nested folders.

To use, click on `Search for folder...` then choose the directory you want to search through. The list box will immediately start listing every file in this drectory in descending order of size, so that you can immediately locate those files that are taking up too much space, then delete them according to your requirements.

Double-clicking on a file, will bring up a menu with relevant stats, along with options to start the file, open the file explorer to the path, and delete the file.

Toggling LiveSearch would indicate whether to update the interface as you are searching, or to halt the interface entirely during the search process. Halting the interface would not allow you to view any files that have been found, and you can only view the contents after the search is completely done. However, turning off LiveSearch is found to be around 10x faster at searching, as no additional time is consumed updating the interface after every search.
